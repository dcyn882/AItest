However, you also discover that they permit unlimited login attempts without any account lockout policy. Which of the following statements is a valid reason why this configuration does not adequately secure the authentication systems?","A: Complex passwords and multi-factor authentication increase the time needed for user authentication, leading to a higher chance of denial-of-service attacks.","B: Unlimited login attempts without an account lockout policy could allow a brute force attack, undermining the effectiveness of complex passwords and multi-factor authentication.","C: Multi-factor authentication is incompatible with web applications that require high availability.","D: Complex password requirements might cause users to write down passwords, which is a less significant risk than brute force attacks.",B

A colleague argues that this is acceptable since it allows the IT support staff to easily access logs for troubleshooting. Which of the following is the most valid counterargument to this claim?","A: Allowing execute permissions on log files is necessary for IT support staff to run diagnostic tools.","B: Setting logs to be world-readable does not pose a security risk since logs do not contain sensitive information.","C: Log files should be strictly confidential and only accessible by authorized personnel to prevent potential leak of sensitive data.","D: Reducing permissions may prevent the web server from writing new entries to the logs, undermining their purpose.",C

If the key \(K\) and message \(M\) are given as described in the AES-EMAC process, what steps will correctly result in the computation of the tag \(T\) for message \(M\), and what would likely occur if one of the steps is modified?","A: The message \(M\) is divided into 128-bit blocks and an initial state \(S_0 = 0\) is set. Then, each block is combined with the previous state and encrypted with key \(K_1\) to compute the sequence \(S_i\). Altering the initial state to a non-zero value might lead to an incorrect tag that cannot be verified.","B: Two keys \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are derived from the main key \(K\). The final tag \(T\) is calculated by encrypting the last state \(S_n\) with \(K_1\), and modifying the key derivation process could result in a security breach allowing tag forgery.","C: Each 128-bit block of the message \(M\) is directly encrypted with key \(K_2\) without the XOR operation with the previous state, and the final tag is the result of the encryption of the last block. Skipping the XOR step and using the wrong key may lead to predictable tags that can be forged.","D: The message \(M\) is processed in blocks, XORed with a cumulative state encrypted by \(K_1\), and the final tag is produced by encrypting the cumulative state \(S_n\) with \(K_2\). Deviating from this block processing method could compromise the integrity of the tag, enabling an attacker to manipulate message authentication.",AD

Which of the following could be potential outcomes of this attack, and what might the attacker have manipulated to achieve these results?","A: The attacker could intercept traffic by offering their IP as the gateway, allowing them to modify packets.","B: The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites by altering the DNS server address in the DHCP offer.","C: The attacker could prevent users from connecting to the network by sending invalid subnet mask configurations.","D: The attacker could gain access to user credentials by providing a false SSH server in the DHCP options.",AB

The logs indicate repeated access to local browser storage files such as `%APPDATA%/Google/Chrome`. Given the scenario, which of the following are potential implications of this activity? (Select TWO.)","A: It may indicate an adversary's attempt to gather browser information such as bookmarks and browsing history.","B: The access patterns could suggest routine software updates to the browser application.","C: Repeated access may be a sign of a user consolidating their browser data for migration to a new device.","D: Such activity might represent an adversary leveraging browser information to identify additional targets within the network.",AD

Which of the following CORS configurations could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities?","A: The application sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to a specific domain that the application expects to receive requests from.","B: The application uses a wildcard in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header indicating all domains are allowed.","C: The application includes the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header with a value of 'true' and sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the requesting domain, not a wildcard.","D: The server implements a check to validate the Origin request header against a list of allowed domains before sending the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.",B
